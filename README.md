# Monte-carlo-simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that has revolutionized problem-solving in various fields. By harnessing the power of random sampling and statistical analysis, it provides a robust framework for tackling complex and uncertain problems.
## The dice game
Our simple game will involve two six-sided dice. In order to win, the player needs to roll the same number on both dice. A six-sided die has six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). With two dice, there is now 36 possible outcomes (1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc., or 6 x 6 = 36 possibilities). In this game, the house has more opportunities to win (30 outcomes vs. the player’s 6 outcomes), meaning the house has the quite the advantage.
## Results
From our figure, we can determine that the player rarely makes a profit after 1,000 rolls. In fact, the average ending balance of our 10,000 simulations is $833.66 (your results may be slightly different due to randomization). So, even though the house was “generous” in paying out 4 times our bet when the player won, the house still came out on top. We also notice that our win probability is about 0.1667, or approximately 1/6.
